# DSA-Stack

This repository provides implementations of the Stack data structure using two different approaches: **Array-based** and **LinkedList-based**.

## Features
- **Stack using Array**: Implements basic stack operations such as push, pop, peek, and isEmpty using an array.
- **Stack using LinkedList**: Implements stack operations using a linked list, offering dynamic memory allocation.

## Files in the Repository
1. `StackArray.java`: Array-based stack implementation.
2. `StackArrayMain.java`: Main class to demonstrate usage of the array-based stack.
3. `StackLinkedList.java`: LinkedList-based stack implementation.
4. `StackLinkedListMain.java`: Main class to demonstrate usage of the linked list-based stack.
5. `Node.java`: Helper class to represent a node in the linked list.
6. `Stack Notes.pdf`: PDF containing notes and explanation about stack operations.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to either the `StackArrayMain.java` or `StackLinkedListMain.java` files to see the implementations in action.
3. Modify the classes or extend the functionality as per your requirements.

## Installation

To use the stack implementations, you need:
- **Java**: Make sure you have Java installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
  
After cloning the repository, you can compile and run the Java files from the command line:
```bash
javac StackArrayMain.java
java StackArrayMain
